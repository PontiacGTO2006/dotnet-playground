# dotnet-playground
Playground for the dotnet Udemy course, building an app with ASPNET and Angular.
Project languages include: C#, CSS, HTML, TypeScript.
This repository houses a dating app which is supposed to allow users to find and message each other on a virtual network. It is currently in progress.
Toolset: Visual Studio Code and Postman. The only reason there's a .vs folder is that I opened the repo in Visual Studio as a test during repo setup. VS Code is used mainly for development.
API components: dotnet-powered web API and Angular API. Entity Framework is also being put to use.
